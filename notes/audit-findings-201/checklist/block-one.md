## 102. Document potential edge cases for hook receiver contracts

The functions withdrawTokenAndCall() and withdrawTokenAndCallOnBehalf() make a call to a hook contract designated by the owner of the withdrawing stealth address. There are very few constraints on the parameters to these calls in the Umbra contract itself. Anyone can force a call to a hook contract by transferring a small amount of tokens to an address that they control and withdrawing these tokens, passing the target address as the hook receiver.

1. Recommendation: Developers of these UmbraHookReceiver contracts should be sure to validate both the caller of the tokensWithdrawn() function and the function parameters.

## 103. Document token behavior restrictions

As with any protocol that interacts with arbitrary ERC20 tokens, it is important to clearly document which tokens are supported. Often this is best done by providing a specification for the behavior of the expected ERC20 tokens and only relaxing this specification after careful review of a particular class of tokens and their interactions with the protocol.

1. Recommendation: Known deviations from “normal” ERC20 behavior should be explicitly noted as NOT supported by the Umbra Protocol: 1) Deflationary or fee-on-transfer tokens: These are tokens in which the balance of the recipient of a transfer may not be increased by the amount of the transfer. There may also be some alternative mechanism by which balances are unexpectedly decreased. While these tokens can be successfully sent via the sendToken() function, the internal accounting of the Umbra contract will be out of sync with the balance as recorded in the token contract, resulting in loss of funds. 2) Inflationary tokens: The opposite of deflationary tokens. The Umbra contract provides no mechanism for claiming positive balance adjustments. 3) Rebasing tokens: A combination of the above cases, these are tokens in which an account’s balance increases or decreases along with expansions or contractions in supply. The contract provides no mechanism to update its internal accounting in response to these unexpected balance adjustments, and funds may be lost as a result.

## 104. Full test suite is recommended

The test suite at this stage is not complete and many of the tests fail to execute. For complicated systems such as DeFi Saver, which uses many different modules and interacts with different DeFi protocols, it is crucial to have a full test coverage that includes the edge cases and failed scenarios. Especially this helps with safer future development and upgrading each module. As we’ve seen in some smart contract incidents, a complete test suite can prevent issues that might be hard to find with manual reviews.

1. Recommendation: Add a full coverage test suite.

## 105. Kyber getRates code is unclear

Function names don’t reflect their true functionalities, and the code uses some undocumented assumptions.

1. Recommendation: Refactor the code to separate getting rate functionality with getSellRate and getBuyRate. Explicitly document any assumptions in the code ( slippage, etc).
2. [ConsenSys' Audit of DeFi Saver](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/03/defi-saver/#kyber-getrates-code-is-unclear)

## 106. Return value is not used for TokenUtils.withdrawTokens

The return value of TokenUtils.withdrawTokens which represents the actual amount of tokens that were transferred is never used throughout the repository. This might cause discrepancy in the case where the original value of \_amount was type(uint256).max.

1. Recommendation: The return value can be used to validate the withdrawal or used in the event emitted.

## 107. Missing access control for DefiSaverLogger.Log

DefiSaverLogger is used as a logging aggregator within the entire dapp, but anyone can create logs.

1. Recommendation: Add access control to all functions appropriately.
2. [ConsenSys' Audit of DeFi Saver](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/03/defi-saver/#missing-access-control-for-defisaverlogger-log)

## 108. Remove stale comments

Remove inline comments that suggest the two uint256 values DAOfiV1Pair.reserveBase and DAOfiV1Pair.reserveQuote are stored in the same storage slot. This is likely a carryover from the UniswapV2Pair contract, in which reserve0, reserve1, and blockTimestampLast are packed into a single storage slot.

1. Recommendation: Remove stale comments
2. [ConsenSys' Audit of DAOfi](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/02/daofi/#remove-stale-comments)

## 109. Discrepancy between code and comments

There is a mismatch between what the code implements and what the corresponding comment describes that code implements.

1. Recommendation: Update the code or the comment to be consistent.

## 110. Remove unnecessary call to `DAOfiV1Factory.formula()`

The DAOfiV1Pair functions initialize(), getBaseOut(), and getQuoteOut() all use the private function \_getFormula(), which makes a call to the factory to retrieve the address of the BancorFormula contract. The formula address in the factory is set in the constructor and cannot be changed, so these calls can be replaced with an immutable value in the pair contract that is set in its constructor.

1. Recommendation: Remove unnecessary calls.
2. [ConsenSys' Audit of DAOfi](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/02/daofi/#remove-unnecessary-call-to-daofiv1factory-formula)

## 111. Deeper validation of curve math

Increased testing of edge cases in complex mathematical operations could have identified at least one issue raised in this report. Additional unit tests are recommended, as well as fuzzing or property-based testing of curve-related operations. Improperly validated interactions with the BancorFormula contract are seen to fail in unanticipated and potentially dangerous ways, so care should be taken to validate inputs and prevent pathological curve parameters.

1. Recommendation: More validation of mathematical operations.

## 112. GovernorAlpha proposals may be canceled by the proposer, even after they have been accepted and queued

GovernorAlpha allows proposals to be canceled via cancel. A proposer may cancel proposals in any of these states: Pending, Active, Canceled, Defeated, Succeeded, Queued, Expired.

1. Recommendation: Prevent proposals from being canceled unless they are in the Pending or Active states.

## 113. eRLC: Require a delay period before granting `KYC_ADMIN_ROLE`

The KYC Admin has the ability to freeze the funds of any user at any time by revoking the KYC_MEMBER_ROLE. The trust requirements from users can be decreased slightly by implementing a delay on granting this ability to new addresses. While the management of private keys and admin access is outside the scope of this review, the addition of a time delay can also help protect the development team and the system itself in the event of private key compromise.

1. Recommendation: Use a `TimelockController` as the `KYC_DEFAULT_ADMIN` of the eRLC contract.
2. [ConsenSys' Audit of eRLC](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/01/erlc-iexec/#erlc-require-a-delay-period-before-granting-kyc-admin-role)

## 114. Improve inline documentation and test coverage

The source-units hardly contain any inline documentation which makes it hard to reason about methods and how they are supposed to be used. Additionally, test-coverage seems to be limited. Especially for a public-facing exchange contract system test-coverage should be extensive, covering all methods and functions that can directly be accessed including potential security-relevant and edge-cases. This would have helped in detecting some of the findings raised with this report.

1. Recommendation: Consider adding natspec-format compliant inline code documentation, describe functions, what they are used for, and who is supposed to interact with them. Document function or source-unit specific assumptions. Increase test coverage.

## 115. Unspecific compiler version pragma

For most source-units the compiler version pragma is very unspecific ^0.6.0. While this often makes sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of an application, it may be a security risk for the actual application implementation itself. A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up actually checking a different evm compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

1. Recommendation: Avoid floating pragmas. We highly recommend pinning a concrete compiler version (latest without security issues) in at least the top-level “deployed” contracts to make it unambiguous which compiler version is being used. Rule of thumb: a flattened source-unit should have at least one non-floating concrete solidity compiler version pragma.

## 116. Use of hardcoded gas limits can be problematic

Hardcoded gas limits can be problematic as the past has shown that gas economics in ethereum have changed, and may change again potentially rendering the contract system unusable in the future.

1. Recommendation: Be conscious about this potential limitation and prepare for the case where gas prices might change in a way that negatively affects the contract system.

## 117. Anyone can steal all the funds that belong to `ReferralFeeReceiver`

The ReferralFeeReceiver receives pool shares when users swap() tokens in the pool. A ReferralFeeReceiver may be used with multiple pools and, therefore, be a lucrative target as it is holding pool shares. Any token or ETH that belongs to the ReferralFeeReceiver is at risk and can be drained by any user by providing a custom mooniswap pool contract that references existing token holdings. It should be noted that none of the functions in ReferralFeeReceiver verify that the user-provided mooniswap pool address was actually deployed by the linked MooniswapFactory.

1. Recommendation: Enforce that the user-provided mooniswap contract was actually deployed by the linked factory. Other contracts cannot be trusted. Consider implementing token sorting and de-duplication (tokenA!=tokenB) in the pool contract constructor as well. Consider employing a reentrancy guard to safeguard the contract from reentrancy attacks. Improve testing. The methods mentioned here are not covered at all. Improve documentation and provide a specification that outlines how this contract is supposed to be used.

## 118. Unpredictable behavior for users due to admin front running or general bad timing

In a number of cases, administrators of contracts can update or upgrade things in the system without warning. This has the potential to violate a security goal of the system. Specifically, privileged roles could use front running to make malicious changes just ahead of incoming transactions, or purely accidental negative effects could occur due to the unfortunate timing of changes. In general users of the system should have assurances about the behavior of the action they’re about to take.

1. Recommendation: We recommend giving the user advance notice of changes with a time lock. For example, make all system-parameter and upgrades require two steps with a mandatory time window between them. The first step merely broadcasts to users that a particular change is coming, and the second step commits that change after a suitable waiting period. This allows users that do not accept the change to withdraw immediately.

## 119. Improve system documentation and create a complete technical specification

A system’s design specification and supporting documentation should be almost as important as the system’s implementation itself. Users rely on high-level documentation to understand the big picture of how a system works. Without spending time and effort to create palatable documentation, a user’s only resource is the code itself, something the vast majority of users cannot understand. Security assessments depend on a complete technical specification to understand the specifics of how a system works. When a behavior is not specified (or is specified incorrectly), security assessments must base their knowledge in assumptions, leading to less effective review. Maintaining and updating code relies on supporting documentation to know why the system is implemented in a specific way. If code maintainers cannot reference documentation, they must rely on memory or assistance to make high-quality changes. Currently, the only documentation for Growth DeFi is a single README file, as well as code comments.

1. Recommendation: Improve system documentation and create a complete technical specification.

## 120. Ensure system states, roles, and permissions are sufficiently restrictive

Smart contract code should strive to be strict. Strict code behaves predictably, is easier to maintain, and increases a system’s ability to handle nonideal conditions. Our assessment of Growth DeFi found that many of its states, roles, and permissions are loosely defined.

1. Recommendation: Document the use of administrator permissions. Monitor the usage of administrator permissions. Specify strict operation requirements for each contract.
