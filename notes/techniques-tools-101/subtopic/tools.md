# Security Tools

## Smart contract security tools

Tools are critical in assisting smart contract developers and auditors with showcasing (potentially) exploitable vulnerabilities, highlighting dangerous programming styles or surfacing common patterns of misuse. None of these however replace the need for manual review/validation to evaluate contract-specific business logic and other complex control-flow, data-flow & value-flow aspects.

## Security tool categories

tools for testing, test coverage, linting, disassembling, visualization, static analysis, dynamic analysis and formal verification of smart contracts.

## Security tool impact

Smart contract security tools are useful in assisting auditors while reviewing smart contracts. They automate many of the tasks that can be codified into rules with different levels of coverage, correctness and precision. They are fast, cheap, scalable and deterministic compared to manual analysis. But they are also susceptible to false positives. They are especially well-suited currently to detect common security pitfalls and best-practices at the Solidity and EVM level. With varying degrees of manual assistance, they can also be programmed to check for application-level, business-logic constraints.
